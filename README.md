# Quantum Dynamics - Wavefunction Evolution

QD Project for the Quantum Dynamics course of the Atomistic and Multiscale Computational Modelling Master Degree.

By combining principles from quantum mechanics, numerical methods, and programming, a well-developed wavefunction propagation program enables simulations and exploration of simple quantum systems. Here, a Python program that propagates a wave packet under a specified potential has been developed, considering a simple Euler integration method and a more robust Runge-Kutta 4 method. After the simulation, it provides an animation (GIF) of its evolution.
