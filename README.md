# Quantum Dynamics - Wavefunction Evolution

QD Project for the Quantum Dynamics course of the Atomistic and Multiscale Computational Modelling Master Degree.

The script integrates the quantum wavefunction by solving the Shr√∂dinger equation with dicrete time, providing an animation (GIF) of its evolution.
